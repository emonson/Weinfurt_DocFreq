MURDOCK STUDY BIOREPOSITORY
Informed Consent Template

Researchers are trying to learn more about cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems.  Much of this research is done using human tissue or blood.  Researchers often study tissue or blood from people who have health problems and from people who do not.
You are being asked to let some of your blood be stored for possible use in this kind of research.  This is because you agreed to take part in or may be eligible for a study organized as part of the larger Murdock Study.  Important details about this storage project are given below.  Please read this information carefully and take your time making your decision.  Be sure to ask us about anything that does not seem clear.
Some general things you should know about taking part in research are:
•	Research is meant to gain knowledge that may help people in the future.  You may or may not get any direct benefit from taking part.  Taking part may also involve some risks.
•	Research includes only those people who choose to take part.  You should feel free to talk over your decision with your family, friends, doctor, and health care team.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT?
The purpose of this project is to collect and store tissue samples (such as blood) and health information so they will be available for use in future research studies.  Researchers can do many kinds of studies using these materials.  Some may use the samples and information to look for new ways to diagnose, treat, and maybe even prevent or cure health problems.  Others may use them to study how genes affect health, or how genes affect response to treatment.  Some of the studies may lead to new products, such as drugs or tests for diseases.
A collection of stored samples and information is called a biorepository.  This collection is called the Murdock Study Biorepository (just called the “Biorepository” in the rest of this consent form).  The director of the Biorepository is [INSERT NAME].

WHAT IS INVOLVED IF I DECIDE TO TAKE PART?
If you agree to take part in this project, you will be asked to sign this consent form.  We will give you a signed copy of the consent form to keep.  Here is what would happen next:

1.	We will obtain a blood sample from you.
If you agree, we will draw 50 ml (about 3 tablespoons) of blood from a vein in your arm by needle stick.
From this sample, we may be able to extract things DNA and RNA.
•	‘DNA’ is short for deoxyribonucleic acid.  DNA stores information in the form of a code.  Sections of DNA that contain complete messages are known as ‘genes.’  Genes give the instructions for building all the proteins that make our bodies work.  Genes carry information that is passed on to future generations.
•	‘RNA’ is short for ribonucleic acid.  RNA delivers DNA’s genetic message to the part of a cell where proteins are made.  RNA gives some information about which genes are turned on or off at a particular point in time.  However, RNA is not passed on from generation to generation.

2.	We will collect some information about you and your health.
First, we will ask you for some basic information.  This will include things like name, age, and racial or ethnic group.  We will also ask about your family’s health history.  If you agree, someone from the Biorepository will contact you no more than once a year to update this information.  This will happen for as long as your sample is stored in the Biorepository.
Second, we will collect some information from your medical record.  Examples include information about your diagnoses, lab results, medical procedures, and medications.  This is because future researchers need to know if you have any problems with your health.  They may also need to know about any treatments you have had and how well the treatments worked.  If you agree, updated information will be collected from your medical record from time to time.  This will happen for as long as your sample is stored in the Biorepository.
Third, we will collect research data from any Murdock studies in which you take part.

3.	We will store your sample and information in the Biorepository.
Your blood and information will be kept in the Biorepository along with those from all the other people who decide to take part.  There is no limit on the length of time we will keep your blood and information.  We will keep them as long as they are useful, unless you decide you no longer want to take part or we close the Biorepository.

4.	Researchers may use your sample and information in future studies.
Researchers can apply to study the materials stored in the Biorepository.  A research committee at the Biorepository will review each application.  An ethics review will also be done.  This kind of review is to make sure that risks are minimized and that the rights and welfare of people who take part in research are protected.
If a study is approved, a part of your blood and some information about your health might be given to the researchers, along with samples and information from many other people.  However, we will not give researchers your name or any other information that could identify you without your permission.  There are more details about this in the part below called “How Will Information About Me Be Kept Private?”
Materials stored in the Biorepository will be used mainly by researchers at Duke University.  Researchers from other universities, the government, and drug- or health-related companies can also apply to use them.  Only skilled researchers will be allowed to study the samples and information.

5.	Researchers may apply to do studies that involve contact with you.
You will not be notified every time your sample and information are used in a study.  However, some researchers might apply to do a study for which they would need to contact you.  For example, they might want to ask you to fill out a questionnaire or take a telephone survey.
If a study like this is approved, someone from the Biorepository will contact you first.  We will tell you about the study so you can decide if it is okay for us to give the researcher your name.  If you agree, the researcher will then contact you to tell you more about the study.  There will be a new consent process just for that study, so you can make your final decision about taking part.
We will make sure not to contact you about studies like this more than twice a year.  You can also decide, now or later, that you never want to be contacted about studies like these.

6.	Some of your genetic and health information may be placed in a scientific database.
In order to speed research, it is often helpful for researchers to share the genetic information they obtain from studying blood or tissue samples.  Other researchers can then compare that information to the genetic information from people in other studies.  By sharing information, researchers can learn even more about important medical questions.
If you agree, parts of your genetic information and some of your health information may be released into one or more scientific databases.  There are many scientific databases where your information may go.  Some are maintained by Duke University, some are maintained by the National Institutes of Health, and some are maintained by private companies.  Some of these databases can be accessed by the public.  Others are restricted and can only be accessed by approved researchers.
We will never release your name or any other information that could directly identify you into a scientific database.  Nobody will be able to know just from looking at a database that the information belongs to you.

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS OR DISCOMFORTS?
Physical Risks. Like any other time you have blood drawn, you may feel brief discomfort or have some bruising from the needle.  Infection, excess bleeding, clotting or fainting is also possible, but unlikely.
Privacy Risks. There is a risk that someone could get access to the data we have stored about you.  If those data suggested something serious about your health, it could be misused.  For example, it could be used to make it harder for you to get or keep a job or insurance.  There are laws against this kind of misuse, but they may not give full protection.  We believe the chance of these things ever happening is very small, but we cannot make guarantees.  Your privacy and the confidentiality of your data are very important to us and we will make every effort to protect them.  These efforts are described in the part below called “How Will Information About Me Be Kept Private?”
Scientific Databases. Although we will never release any information that could directly identify you into a scientific database, your genetic information is unique to you.  Therefore, there is a chance that someone could trace the information back to you.  The risk of this happening is very small, but it may grow in the future.  As technology advances, the information in these databases will become more valuable to researchers, but there may also be new ways of tracing the information back to you.

HOW WILL INFORMATION ABOUT ME BE KEPT PRIVATE?
Project records that identify you will be kept confidential, as required by law.  Federal Privacy Regulations provide safeguards for privacy, security, and authorized access.
Blood samples will be stored in locked freezers in locked buildings.  Health information and research data will be stored on secure computers with many levels of password protection.  In addition, research records are separate from medical records, and information collected or generated as part of this research project will not be placed in your official medical record by research staff.  Information that identifies you will not be disclosed to third parties without your permission, except when required by law.
Your sample and health information will be labeled with a code number.  Your name and anything else that could directly identify you will be removed and kept in a separate file.  There will be a master list that links the code number to your name.  This list will be stored on secure computer with many levels of password protection.  Only a few of the Biorepository staff will have access to the list and they have signed a pledge to keep your identity a secret.
Researchers who study your sample and information will not know who you are.  We will only give them the code number and not any information that directly identifies you.  The researchers must promise that they will not try to identify you, and that they will keep the coded materials secure.
Your records may be reviewed in order to meet federal or state regulations.  Reviewers could include, for example, representatives from a federal agency (such as the Food and Drug Administration) or the sponsor of a particular study.  A reviewer who looks at your research record may also need to review your entire medical record.  If information is disclosed to such a reviewer, it is no longer protected by patient privacy regulations (called ‘HIPAA’), but it will be protected by other federal privacy regulations.

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS?
You will most likely not benefit directly if you decide to take part in this project.  The main reason you may want to take part is to help researchers make discoveries that may benefit people in the future.

ARE THERE ANY COSTS OR PAYMENTS?
There are no costs to you or your insurance for taking part in the Biorepository.  You will not be paid for taking part in the Biorepository.  Your sample will be used only for research and will not be sold.
You should know that blood and tissue samples may be valuable for scientific, research, or teaching purposes.  In addition, research sometimes results in discoveries that may one day have commercial value.  For example, discoveries could eventually lead to new tests, drugs, or other medical products.  By agreeing to take part in this project, you authorize the Biorepository to make your sample available for these purposes.
In the event that research using samples stored in the Biorepository results in a product that could be sold commercially, you should not expect to share in any of the profits.  Development of new products usually relies on the study of samples from hundreds or thousands of people, not on any one person.  DUHS and/or the developers will assert all rights of ownership in the samples, as well as all rights arising from use of the samples.

WILL I FIND OUT THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH?
Research Results. You should not expect to get individual results from research done using your sample.  Researchers must study samples and information from many people over many years before they can know if the results have meaning.  The results will not affect your care right now.  They will not be given to your doctor and will not be put in your medical record.
You can get general news about the kinds of studies being done through the Biorepository at [INSERT URL].
Incidental Findings. There is a small chance that researchers using your sample could learn something about your health that you and your doctor did not know before.  For example, they might find that you inherited a gene that is already known to increase risk for a disease.  We will offer to tell you a finding like this only if it is about a disease that is likely to cause early death if not treated.  We will send a letter by certified mail asking you to contact [INSERT NAME].  The findings will not be given out over the telephone or by mail.  [INSERT NAME] will arrange a time for you to meet with him or another health care provider to go over the information.

WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS?
Taking part in the Biorepository is completely voluntary.  You can choose to take part or not take part.  Taking part in the Biorepository means letting us obtain and store a blood sample, along with some basic health information, for possible use in future research.  In addition, there are some optional parts.  These are listed in the section called “Consent Statement.”  You can still take part in the Biorepository even if you choose not to participate in any of the optional parts.
You can change your mind at any time, about any of your optional choices or about taking part in the Biorepository at all.  There is more information in the next section about what to do if you change your mind.
No matter what you decide, now or in the future, it will not affect your medical care.  There will not be any penalty to you and you will not lose any benefits you would otherwise be able to get.

WHAT IF I CHANGE MY MIND?
If you agree to take part in the Biorepository, you are free to change your mind at any time.  If you change your mind, please contact [INSERT NAME] at [INSERT NUMBER] and let him know.  At that time, we will send you a form so that you can tell us in writing whether you want to make changes to your optional choices or if you want to stop taking part in the Biorepository all together.
Please note that if some of your sample and information has already been given out for study, it cannot be called back.  Also, knowledge already gained from the study of samples and information cannot be destroyed.  However, you can tell us what you would like us to do with any of your sample that is left.

WHAT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?
You should feel free to ask any questions.  Your questions should be answered clearly and to your satisfaction.  For questions about the project, contact [INSERT NAME], the Project Director, at [INSERT NUMBER].  You can also call [INSERT NAME], the Study Coordinator, at [INSERT NUMBER].  For questions about your rights as a research participant, contact Duke University Health System Institutional Review Board Office at (919) 668-5111.
