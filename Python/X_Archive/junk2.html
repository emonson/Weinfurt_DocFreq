<para><font size=${s_20} color=${c_20}>The purpose of this project is to collect and store tissue samples (such as blood) and health information. Researchers can then study the stored materials.</font>
<font size=${s_21} color=${c_21}>Through such studies, they hope to find new ways to detect, treat, and maybe even prevent or cure health problems.</font>
<font size=${s_22} color=${c_22}>Some of these studies may be about how genes affect health, or how genes affect response to treatment.</font>
<font size=${s_23} color=${c_23}>(Genes, which are made up of DNA, have all the information needed to build and operate a human body.) </font>
<font size=${s_24} color=${c_24}>Some of the studies may lead to new products, such as drugs or tests for diseases.</font></para>
<para><font size=${s_25} color=${c_25}>A “Biorepository” is a collection of samples and information. This collection is called the Murdock Study Biorepository (or just “the Biorepository” in the rest of this form).</font>

<para leftIndent=24 firstLineIndent=24><font size=${s_67} color=${c_67}>In order to speed research, it is often helpful for researchers to share the genetic information they get from studying blood or tissue samples.

<para><font size=${s_76} color=${c_76}><u>Privacy Risks</u>. There is a risk that someone could get access to the data we have stored about you.</font>
<font size=${s_77} color=${c_77}>If those data suggested something serious about your health, it could be misused. For example, it could be used to make it harder for you to get or keep a job or insurance.</font></para>
<para><font size=${s_78} color=${c_78}>There are laws against this kind of misuse. For example, North Carolina law says employers cannot deny someone a job based on genetic information (§95-28.1A). It also says insurers cannot charge more or refuse to cover someone based on genetic information (§58-3-215).</font>
<font size=${s_79} color=${c_79}>But such laws may not give full protection.</font></para>
<para><font size=${s_80} color=${c_80}>We believe the chance of your information being misused is very small, but we cannot make guarantees.</font>
<font size=${s_81} color=${c_81}>Your privacy and the confidentiality of your data are very important to us and we will make every effort to protect them.</font>

Reviewers could include, for example, people from a federal agency (such as the Food and Drug Administration) or the sponsor of a particular study.
