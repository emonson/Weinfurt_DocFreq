MURDOCK STUDY BIOREPOSITORY
Informed Consent Template

Researchers are trying to learn more about cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems.  Much of this research is done using human tissue, such as blood.  Through such studies, researchers hope to find new ways to diagnose, treat, and maybe even prevent or cure health problems.  Some of these studies may be about how genes affect health and disease.
You are being asked to let some of your blood be stored for possible use in future research.  This is because you agreed to take part in or may be eligible for a study organized as part of the larger Murdock Study.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT?  The purpose of the Murdock Study Biorepository is to collect and store tissue and health information so they will be available for future medical research.

WHAT IS INVOLVED?  If you agree to take part in this project, here is what will happen:
1.	We will obtain a blood sample from you. If you agree, we will draw about 3 tablespoons of blood from a vein in your arm.
2.	We will collect some information about you and your health. If you agree, we will collect and store the following information for as long as your sample is stored in the Biorepository:
•	We will ask you for some basic information, such as your name, age, race, and family’s health history.  Someone from the Biorepository will contact you no more than once a year to update this information.
•	We will collect some information from your medical record so that future researchers will know about any health problems you may have.  Your medical record will be used from time to time to get updated health information.
•	We will collect research data from any Murdock studies in which you take part.
3.	We will store your sample and information in the Biorepository. There is no limit on the length of time it will be stored.
4.	Researchers can apply to study the materials stored in the Biorepository. A research committee at the Biorepository will review each application.  If approved, a part of your blood and some information about your health may be given to some of the researchers, along with samples and information from many other people.  We will not give researchers your name or any other information that could directly identify you.
5.	Researchers may apply to do studies that involve contact with you. For example, some researchers might want to ask you to fill out a survey.  If a study like this is approved, someone from the Biorepository will contact you first.  If you decide it is okay for us to give the researcher your name, the researcher will then contact you to tell you more about the study.  We will make sure not to contact you about studies like this more than twice a year.
6.	Some of your information may be placed in scientific databases.  If you agree, some of your genetic and health information may be shared so that other researchers can learn from it.  This will happen by releasing the information, with no direct identifiers, into scientific databases.  Some of these databases are publicly accessible.  Others can be accessed only be approved researchers.

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS OR DISCOMFORTS?  The most common risks associated with drawing blood from your arm are momentary discomfort and/or bruising.
There is a risk that someone could get access to the data we have stored about you.  If those data suggested something serious about your health, it could be misused.  For example, it could be used to make it harder for you to get or keep a job or insurance.  We believe the chance of this happening is very small, but we cannot make guarantees.
There is a chance that someone could trace the information in a scientific database back to you.  Even though direct identifiers will never be released into these databases, your genetic information is unique to you.  The risk of being identified is very small, but it may grow in the future.  This is because new ways of tracing information may be developed.

HOW WILL INFORMATION ABOUT ME BE KEPT PRIVATE?  Your privacy is very important to us and we will make every effort to protect it.  Here are just a few of the steps we will take:
•	All Biorepository staff sign a pledge to keep your identity a secret.
•	Your name and other information that could identify you will be removed from your sample and replaced with a code number.
•	The list that links the code number to your name will be kept separate from your sample and information.  Only a few of the Biorepository staff will have access to the list.
•	Researchers who study the samples will not be given information that could identify you.  They must also promise that they will not try to identify you.
•	Your name and other direct identifiers will never be released into a scientific database.  Nobody would know just from looking at a database that the information belongs to you.

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS?  There will most likely not be any direct benefits to you.  The main reason you may want to take part is to help researchers make discoveries that may benefit people in the future.

ARE THERE ANY COSTS OR PAYMENTS?  There are no costs to you or your insurance.  You will not be paid for taking part.  If the research leads to the development of new tests, drugs, or other commercial products, you should not expect to share in any profits.

WILL I FIND OUT THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH?  You should not expect to get individual results from research done using your sample.  You can get general news about the kinds of studies being done through the Biorepository at [INSERT URL].

WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS?  Taking part in the Biorepository is completely voluntary.  If you choose to take part, you can change your mind at any time.  No matter what you decide, now or in the future, it will not affect your medical care.

WHAT IF I CHANGE MY MIND? Just call [INSERT NUMBER] and let us know you have changed your mind.  We will send you a form so you can tell us in writing what you would like us to do with any of your blood that has not already been given out for study.
